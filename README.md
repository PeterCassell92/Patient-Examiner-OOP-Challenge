The challenge took me approximately 3 hours to complete.

Features

    Utilizes core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as Composition and Inheritance.
    Provides a clear separation of concerns between classes, ensuring concise and modular code.
    Implements an OptionSelector class to elegantly handle user selection, offering a more versatile solution compared to the course-provided solution.

Approach

The solution takes an approach that emphasizes class usage to ensure modularity and maintainability. By leveraging Composition and Inheritance, the code neatly solves the challenge and promotes code reusability.
Usage

To use this solution, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Navigate to the project directory.
    Compile and run the main file.
    Follow the on-screen prompts to inspect patient and organ details.

Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

    Main.java: Entry point of the program. Handles user interaction and orchestrates the inspection process.
    Patient.java: Defines the Patient class, representing a patient and their associated information.
    Organ.java: Defines the Organ class, representing an organ and its details.
    OptionSelector.java: Implements the OptionSelector class, providing functionality to elegantly handle user selection.

Notes

This solution offers enhanced versatility compared to the solution provided in the course. The OptionSelector class, in particular, streamlines user selection without relying on hard-coded cases, resulting in a more flexible and maintainable solution.
