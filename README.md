My solution to the challenge uses core OOP principles such as:
-Composition
-Inheritance

to neatly solve the challenge to use a text-interface to inspect patient/ organ details.

I took an approach that went further with Class usage than strictly necessary however it creates clear separation of interest between classes and ensures each file is concise.
